          <p>
            The Affenpinscher is square-proportioned, compact and sturdy, with
            medium bone. This breed is a smaller version of a working terrier,
            and as such is not a delicate dog. This is an active, tough dog that
            is agile enough to catch and dispatch rodents. The gait is light,
            sound, and confident. The Affenpinscher has a monkey-like facial
            expression with long eyebrows and beard, which lends an air of comic
            seriousness.

          <h2 class="stack__card__title">The Akbash Dog</h2>
          <p>
            A unique combination of Mastiff and gazehound features, the Akbash
            Dog&apos;s characteristics enable him to perform as a livestock
            guardian. This all-white, lean, leggy, muscular dog has an alert,
            regal appearance conveying power, strength and courage with the
            speed and agility necessary to challenge and chase predators. His
            wedge-shaped head is adorned with pendant ears and long tail is
            curled over his back when moving or excited. Like other gazehounds,
            the Akbash Dog is characterized by his long legs, deep chest and
            tucked flank; the breed&apos;s Mastiff influence is found in his
            height, weight, broad head and powerful appearance.

          <h2 class="stack__card__title">Alaskan Malamute</h2>
          <p>
            The Alaskan Malamute is a powerfully built dog of Nordic breed type,
            developed to haul heavy loads rather than race. This breed is
            slightly longer than tall, and is heavy boned and compact, designed
            for strength and endurance. The Malamute&apos;s gait is steady,
            balanced, and tireless. The coat is thick and double, with a coarse
            outer coat and dense, wooly, oily undercoat, providing the ultimate
            in insulation. Although the eyes have a “wolf-like” appearance, the
            expression is soft.

            An energetic, active working dog, the American Bulldog exudes a
            dominant, powerful and athletic appearance, with strong muscles and
            substantial boning. He is recognized for his strength, courage and
            working abilities, whether guarding property or driving livestock.
